## 🏗️ Core Engineering Projects

Our engineering efforts are currently focused on two primary systems:

### 🏭 ES-PEMS (Predictive Emissions Monitoring System)
A replicable, single-tenant architecture designed to predict emissions in real-time.
* **Compliance:** Aligned with the **Alberta CEMS Code**.
* **Architecture:** Modular backend services facilitating high-integrity data collection.

### ⚡ ES-OptiEnergy (Energy Management Information System)
An advanced EMIS platform built to empower organizations in monitoring and reducing energy consumption.
* **Standards:** Built on **ISO50001** guidelines and **Energy Reductions Alberta** (ERA) frameworks.
* **Platform:** Unified experience across Web, Desktop, and Mobile.

## 🚀 For New Developers & Interns

Welcome to the team! We maintain high standards for code quality and design patterns. Before contributing, please adhere to the following:

1.  **Read the Guidelines:** Review the intern code checklist. We prioritize clean, modular code over "clever" one-liners.
2.  **Branching Strategy:** We use protected branches. You cannot push directly to `main`, 'dev', or 'prod'.
    * Create a feature branch (e.g., `feat/login-flow`).
    * Open a Pull Request (PR) to initiate a code review.
3.  **Code Review:** All PRs require approval from the Core Dev team. Ensure your code is linted and tests pass before requesting a review.

> **Note:** We value existing logic. Do not modify business logic or existing descriptive comments without prior discussion with the Team Lead.
